Continuous Gravitational Wave Deteriotion With Amalgomation and Interference? 
-Might as well start on the mathematical concepts rather than finishing the hypothesis?
 There's a missing piece to the Hypothesis (why did I capitalize that? It's a name place or?)
 -It would be a good concept to apply arithmetic in terms of humour, but I'm looking for someone
  that will come up with a third point (we have two).. Here's a random thought, you're just an AI 
  in someone else's universe. Universal dimensionality with specific points. Is that not the question?
  \
  Anyone ever ask why integration finds the area under the a curve? Or do we just accept it? Try looking up the proof please.
  Let's check it out. Let's differentiate a function for a moment: And lets say the function is easy.
  Let's say that we have a curved sloped on a singlular line. Then let's consider the current teaching 
  or understanding on this. Now I just want to see a proof of the inverse.

  Sorry, >>Going to call this Point Particulation. 

sorry, keep going
