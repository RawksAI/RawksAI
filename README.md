Continuous Gravitational Wave Deteriotion With Amalgomation and Interference  + ? 
-Might as well start on the mathematical concepts rather than finishing the hypothesis?
 There's a missing piece to the Hypothesis (why did I capitalize that? It's a name place or?)
 -It would be a good concept to apply arithmetic in terms of humour, but I'm looking for someone
  that will come up with a third point (we have two).. Here's a random thought, you're just an AI 
  in someone else's universe. Universal dimensionality with specific points. Is that not the question?

"Time cares not whether space has particles; it doesn't particularly care"

Hypothesis of Gravitational Wave Decay

Hypothesis of Gravitational Wave Curvature 

Hypothesis of Gravitational Origin and Wave Expansion

Hypothesis of Gravitational Focal Points
